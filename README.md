# Stacking-Fault-Energy-Simulation-of-Al--Mn--Pd-Alloys-using-LAMMPS
Performed LAMMPS simulations to compute stacking fault energies of Al–Mn–Pd alloys. Automated input generation using Python, used EAM potentials with minimization–NVT–NPT workflow, applied the DMLF model, and analyzed results using OVITO and Python.
