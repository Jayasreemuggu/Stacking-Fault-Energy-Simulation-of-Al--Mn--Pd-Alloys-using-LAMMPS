This project focuses on the design, analysis, and optimization of a High Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR) system for mineral comminution. The HPGR setup achieves high energy efficiency with a specific energy consumption of 2.2 kWh/t, significantly lower than conventional SAG/ball mill circuits. The system maintains a throughput of 500 t/h, ensuring stable and continuous operation.

Key technical contributions include:
Product Size Control: Achieved a precise product size distribution (P80: 0.6–1.5 mm) to enhance gold liberation and improve downstream recovery processes.
Operational Optimization: Optimized hydraulic forces, roll shell thickness (30–50 mm), and feed distribution to minimize wear, reduce maintenance, and extend equipment life.
Performance Analysis: Studied roll diameter, width, and speed to balance energy efficiency, throughput, and grinding effectiveness.
This project demonstrates practical application of metallurgical principles, equipment design, and process optimization to improve mineral processing efficiency.
